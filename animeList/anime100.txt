When Kamille steals a Titan's prototype Gundam, he soon finds himself in the middle of the dangerous conflict.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":110,"titles":{"en":"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam","en_jp":"Kidou Senshi Zeta Gundam","en_us":"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam","ja_jp":"機動戦士Ζガンダム"},"canonicalTitle":"Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam","abbreviatedTitles":["Mobile Suit Z Gundam"],"averageRating":"77.99","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"48","3":"0","4":"13","5":"1","6":"32","7":"2","8":"73","9":"4","10":"97","11":"3","12":"277","13":"11","14":"565","15":"33","16":"791","17":"35","18":"459","19":"17","20":"601"},"userCount":5620,"favoritesCount":187,"startDate":"1985-03-02","endDate":"1986-02-22","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":1882,"ratingRank":1024,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/64/poster_image/tiny-ee9af7ccb46eeea696c0f93dfbce6e69.jpeg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/64/poster_image/large-9972650a4463ceddf8be44de5181feed.jpeg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/64/poster_image/small-ad783fc716a1fb1f96615b64c7408cc6.jpeg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/64/poster_image/medium-d4900fbc316e1a9ecf507198dbc3c90f.jpeg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/64/poster_image/481c1267df8597dc92c690aeb09f98a9.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/64/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/64/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/64/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/64/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":50,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":1200,"youtubeVideoId":null,"showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/64/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"65","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/65"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:01:15.257Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-29T06:00:06.711Z","slug":"mobile-suit-gundam-zz","synopsis":"The year is Universal Century 0088.

Having control of Strike, Kira joins the Earth Alliance boarding the ship known as Archangel, to protect his friends while despairing over becoming the enemy of his childhood friend and people.","coverImageTopOffset":90,"titles":{"en":"Mobile Suit Gundam Seed","en_jp":"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED","en_us":"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED","ja_jp":"機動戦士ガンダムSEED"},"canonicalTitle":"Mobile Suit Gundam SEED","abbreviatedTitles":["Kidou Senshi Gundam SEED"],"averageRating":"75.82","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"45","3":"0","4":"79","5":"0","6":"100","7":"1","8":"267","9":"3","10":"329","11":"9","12":"711","13":"17","14":"1282","15":"31","16":"1485","17":"19","18":"804","19":"7","20":"1235"},"userCount":10470,"favoritesCount":178,"startDate":"2002-10-05","endDate":"2003-09-27","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":1127,"ratingRank":1631,"ageRating":"R","ageRatingGuide":"17+ (violence & profanity)","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/72/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/72/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/72/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/72/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/72/original.png","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/72/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/72/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/72/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/72/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":50,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":1200,"youtubeVideoId":"xuveD0juESE","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/72/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"73","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/73"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:01:22.915Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-29T06:00:06.711Z","slug":"mobile-suit-gundam-seed-destiny","synopsis":"C.E. 73: While the second battle of Yachin Due brought the war between the Naturals and Coordinators to a close, tensions between the two races are at an all-time high.

However, when they take on a high-rated delivery to bring an orphan girl named Alvis Hamilton to the battleship Silvana, they get dragged into a much greater conflict that pits them against the might of the Guild.\n\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)","coverImageTopOffset":250,"titles":{"en":"Last Exile","en_jp":"Last Exile","ja_jp":"ラストエグザイル"},"canonicalTitle":"Last Exile","abbreviatedTitles":[],"averageRating":"78.33","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"46","3":"0","4":"33","5":"3","6":"24","7":"2","8":"137","9":"1","10":"219","11":"13","12":"598","13":"19","14":"1200","15":"32","16":"1777","17":"25","18":"870","19":"10","20":"1186"},"userCount":13764,"favoritesCount":205,"startDate":"2003-04-08","endDate":"2003-09-30","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":855,"ratingRank":935,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/76/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/76/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/76/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/76/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/76/original.png","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/76/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/76/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/76/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/76/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":26,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":624,"youtubeVideoId":"sG95d8TQomA","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/76/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"77","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/77"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:01:27.162Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-29T06:00:06.711Z","slug":"mai-hime","synopsis":"Thirteen girls, each with the ability to materialize \"Elements\" and summon metallic guardians called \"Childs\" have been brought to Fuuka Academy to battle mysterious creatures called Orphans.

However when Yukito realizes Misuzu's connection to the past, he must decide on whether to leave, or to attempt to break the curse that has bound Kanna in centuries of pain.\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","coverImageTopOffset":75,"titles":{"en":"Air: The Motion Picture","en_jp":"Air Movie","ja_jp":"劇場版AIR"},"canonicalTitle":"Air Movie","abbreviatedTitles":["Gekijouban Air"],"averageRating":"70.04","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"39","3":"0","4":"60","5":"0","6":"69","7":"2","8":"213","9":"1","10":"257","11":"2","12":"513","13":"16","14":"759","15":"7","16":"596","17":"4","18":"276","19":"1","20":"382"},"userCount":4512,"favoritesCount":8,"startDate":"2005-02-05","endDate":"2005-02-05","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":2184,"ratingRank":4435,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"movie","status":"finished","tba":null,"posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/80/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/80/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/80/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/80/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/80/original.png","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/80/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/80/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/80/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/80/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":1,"episodeLength":91,"totalLength":91,"youtubeVideoId":null,"showType":"movie","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/80/anime-staff"}}}},{"id":"81","type":"anime","links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/81"},"attributes":{"createdAt":"2013-02-20T16:01:31.001Z","updatedAt":"2022-10-29T07:21:03.373Z","slug":"aishiteruze-baby","synopsis":"Katakura Kippei is in every way a high school playboy.

However, the Elric brothers soon discover that there is more to the legendary stone than meets the eye, as they are led to the epicenter of a far darker battle than they could have ever imagined.\n\n(Source: MAL)","coverImageTopOffset":70,"titles":{"en":"Fullmetal Alchemist","en_jp":"Hagane no Renkinjutsushi","ja_jp":"鋼の錬金術師"},"canonicalTitle":"Fullmetal Alchemist","abbreviatedTitles":["FMA","Full Metal Alchemist","Fullmetal Alchemist (2003)","HagaRen"],"averageRating":"82.02","ratingFrequencies":{"2":"2151","3":"33","4":"213","5":"26","6":"185","7":"59","8":"3389","9":"63","10":"1140","11":"112","12":"3341","13":"288","14":"15322","15":"645","16":"12849","17":"950","18":"9788","19":"507","20":"32447"},"userCount":114350,"favoritesCount":2068,"startDate":"2003-10-04","endDate":"2004-10-02","nextRelease":null,"popularityRank":35,"ratingRank":126,"ageRating":"PG","ageRatingGuide":"Teens 13 or older","subtype":"TV","status":"finished","tba":"","posterImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/100/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/100/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/100/small.jpg","medium":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/100/medium.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/poster_images/100/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":110,"height":156},"large":{"width":550,"height":780},"small":{"width":284,"height":402},"medium":{"width":390,"height":554}}}},"coverImage":{"tiny":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/100/tiny.jpg","large":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/100/large.jpg","small":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/100/small.jpg","original":"https://media.kitsu.io/anime/cover_images/100/original.jpg","meta":{"dimensions":{"tiny":{"width":840,"height":200},"large":{"width":3360,"height":800},"small":{"width":1680,"height":400}}}},"episodeCount":51,"episodeLength":24,"totalLength":1224,"youtubeVideoId":"NR5HHcLPulc","showType":"TV","nsfw":false},"relationships":{"genres":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/genres","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/genres"}},"categories":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/categories","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/categories"}},"castings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/castings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/castings"}},"installments":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/installments","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/installments"}},"mappings":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/mappings","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/mappings"}},"reviews":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/reviews","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/reviews"}},"mediaRelationships":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/media-relationships","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/media-relationships"}},"characters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/characters"}},"staff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/staff"}},"productions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/productions"}},"quotes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/quotes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/quotes"}},"episodes":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/episodes","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/episodes"}},"streamingLinks":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/streaming-links","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/streaming-links"}},"animeProductions":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/anime-productions","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/anime-productions"}},"animeCharacters":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/anime-characters","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/anime-characters"}},"animeStaff":{"links":{"self":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/relationships/anime-staff","related":"https://kitsu.io/api/edge/anime/100/anime-staff"}}}}]
